# **🎵 Global vs. Local Music Popularity Analysis**  
 
## **📌 Project Overview**  
Music streaming platforms like **Spotify** provide rankings for the most popular songs in various countries. Some songs dominate the **global charts**, while others remain **regionally popular**. However, there is no straightforward way to compare a song’s **international success** with its **local popularity** over time.  
 
This project builds an **end-to-end data pipeline** to analyze and visualize how **song rankings differ between global and country-specific charts**.  
 
### **Key Insights Provided by This Project:**
✅ **Which songs are globally recognized vs. locally popular?**  
✅ **How do song rankings change over time across different regions?**  
✅ **What trends emerge in different countries' music preferences?**  
 
To achieve this, we implement a **batch data pipeline** that processes and visualizes data using modern cloud technologies.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
 
## **📥 Data Extraction with Kaggle API**  
This project uses the **Kaggle API** to download the dataset directly from Kaggle. The API allows automated and reproducible data extraction without manual downloads.  
 
| **Component**              | **Technology**   | **Purpose** |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Terraform | Provisioning cloud resources |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | Kestra | Automating batch data ingestion |
| **Data Storage (Datalake)** | Google Cloud Storage (GCS) | Storing raw Spotify data |
| **Data Warehouse** | BigQuery | Storing, partitioning, and querying transformed data |
| **Data Transformation** | dbt | Cleaning and preparing data for analysis |
| **Visualization & Dashboard** | Looker Studio | Creating interactive reports |
 
Each of these tools is chosen to ensure **scalability, automation, and reproducibility** in handling large datasets efficiently.

| `spotify_id` | Unique identifier for the song |
| `name` | Song title |
| `artists` | Artist(s) associated with the song |
| `daily_rank` | The song's position in the top 50 for a specific day |
| `daily_movement` | Rank change compared to the previous day |
| `weekly_movement` | Rank change compared to the previous week |
| `country` | Country of the ranking (or "Global" for worldwide charts) |
| `snapshot_date` | The date of the ranking |
| `popularity` | A numerical measure of song popularity |
| `is_explicit` | Indicates whether the song has explicit lyrics |
| `duration_ms` | Length of the song in milliseconds |

## **📊 Dashboard Overview**  
 
The final dashboard (built in **Looker Studio**) contains **two key visualizations**:
 
1️⃣ **Categorical Graph:** **Distribution of Songs in Global vs. Local Charts**  
   - Compares the number of songs that appear in both **global** and **country-specific** Top 50 lists.  
   - Helps identify how many songs are **international hits** vs. **regionally popular**.  
 
2️⃣ **Time-Series Graph:** **Trend of a Song’s Rank in Global vs. Local Charts**  
   - Tracks how a song’s position changes over time in both **global rankings** and **a specific country**.  
   - Shows whether songs **gain international traction** or remain local favorites.
